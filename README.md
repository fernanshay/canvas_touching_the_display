# canvas_touching_the_display
Draw on the display just touching it

<strong>How I did it?</strong>

Super easy, just take an AddEventListener to draw through the display with your mouse.

1. First create html file where you keep the <strong>Canvas</strong> and link it with other js file.

2. In js, make a function to create the draw <strong>(draw.beginPath, draw.strokeStyle= "white", etc)</strong>.

3. after that, make an <strong>AddEventListener "mousemove"</strong>. You know that when you make an AddEventListener you need to give it a function, yeah.

4. Create a AddEventLi... function into that put the <strong>first function</strong> that draws.


<strong>to understand better, go to the js.js file*</strong>
